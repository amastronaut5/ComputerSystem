# Content Authoring

All playlists and references are inlined in `/pages/playlists.tsx` for simplicity, but you can move them here as MDX for even richer content.

You can author new sections like:

```mdx
## Computer Architecture

**Playlists**
- [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
- [Black-Schaffer: Computer Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGR50iIOtO36nK6aYlF1sG6a)

**References**
- [CS:APP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)
- [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
```

Or, add quizzes, diagrams, and explanations with MDX components.
